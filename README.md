# Retro.Farm Core Clone with NES and Atari Two system competitive Governance Model....let the fun begin



# Introducing CORE

Retro.Farm NES & Atari are *non-inflationary* *Dual-Governance* *Cryptocurrency* with a twist. Tokens compete against each other for governance rule, popularity, and fanbase. They are designed to earn profit by popularity of the project. The more popular, the more profitable. Buy backs and burns will be done via NFT sales that we will have weekly. NES and Atari are a fixed amount and not mintable. Voting is important with Retro Farm because it is the fanbase or community that drives the popularity of the project, and the project delivers the weekly themed farming from the vote of the governance. If NES wins the vote that week, we do a Nintendo game, however if Atari wins, then we play pacman. Our ultimalte goal with the weekly new farms is to drive massive value for NES and Atari holders through buy backs from the NFT as well as the buy backs from the 3-5% weekly tokens from the new themed pools. Eventually there will be so little NES & Atari tokens that they will moon very hard. Hold tight and Hodl this one....after we launch the shit talking begins and NES & Atari go to outerspace with our token model.

Nes & Atari token holders will battle each other through voting to be the winners each week that gets to pick the newest farm theme.

# Initial Distribution

The Retro Farm team is jumpstarting the project with a liquidity event on Bounce.Finance for both Governance tokens, namely the NES & Atari tokens. By Contributing ETH during Presale, you will recieve tokens, and the contributed ETH will be added to the Uniswap liquidity pool. Once the pools are created the value will stay the same always, as they will not be removed.

# **Deflationary Farming**

Farming tokens have a problem for their owners. To keep users farming, they have to mint more ever more coins. This completely destroys the value of the underlying token, due to excessive inflation. It's easy to find examples of this across the DeFi ecosystem. 

Our solution is called deflationary farming, and it is quite simple in only two steps:

1. Charge a fee on token transfers
2. Users can earn the fee by farming

Tokens are also bought and burned from the proceeds of the NFT commemorative weekly sales.
This simple process means that those holding tokens are able to farm without infinite inflation.

# Keeping **Liquidity Liquid**

All transfers have to be approved by the NES & Atari Transfers smart contract, which will block all
liquidity withdrawals from Uniswap. This will make the market stable and keep the community around long term.                                                                                                                                                                                                 

# **Real Governance**

Retro Farm is designed for great community governance. The communtiy decides everything and the team is your puppet and you are the master community.                                             

If the holders decide RetroFarmsVaults should have a YFI pool, we can set
the ratio of fees it will be able to distribute, as well as when people should be
able to withdraw YFI tokens from it.

This creates an incentive to hold even more NES & Atari. Let the governance begin.

# **1000000 NES & Atari Forever**

Theres absolutely no way to create new NES or Atari tokens. This means the the
circulating supply can only ever go down, period.
